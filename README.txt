INSTALL:
The only things you need to do to install this tool is download the package and download Chromium which is an open source version of Google Chrome.
Chromium Download:
https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/chromium-browser-snapshots/o/Win_x64%2F1135619%2Fmini_installer.exe?generation=1682469386699488&alt=media

Put the above link in your search bar it will download an installer, once downloaded install Chromium. You dont need to do anything to chromium once installed, 
Easy-Apply-Bot will find it just dont move chromium any where.

For more information Refer to my Word Document for the setup Guide.
Setup takes anywhere between 20-40mins. 

Things to know:
This program does not have a GUI, it is completely reliant on the Settings.INI file for you to make changes to it. 
There are some small bugs in chromium that usually happen within the first 3-6 applications, it just freezes and you just need to press enter to unfreeze it this is a rare event.
The fastest time i've seen an application completed start to finish was about 28 seconds. It averages around 37s when doing just docx files, and 55-65 seconds when doing PDF's.
In 24 hours it is nothing to do 1500 applications. I'm also working on a multi-instance version. 
You dont need to do anything other then setup for your own job search criteria, nothing more.
