Hi, User.... 

I'v created the program to allow you to quickly search for jobs.
Auto Apply Dice is extremely customizable and efficient in completing Easy Apply applications on Dice.com
There currently is no gui for the software but one will be coming soon.

Before you First run there are a few things you need to do...
Sign into Dice.com on you chrome web browser.
identify which Icon, and window youd like to use for Easy Apply Application to utilize. 
"Icon as in where is chrome on your taskbar." 
"Window as when you hover over the chrome icon which window is it using...
Doing a Dry Run to make sure that if you need to upload a document using the Easy Apply Application software ensure that the upload location is the same location where your Resume and or Coverletter are.
if your not using stacked windows on your windows machine just set it to zero" 
If you dont want Easy Apply Application to run through all search results you can do searches manually create tabs yourself and start the software.
IF you want to let it run through all possible jobs based on keywords. And run all night or day thats fine too.

Easy Apply Application identifies what screen is currently active before each run, and restarts each time the run is over.
Set up the Keywords file in the working directory (where ever you have the program stored) and add key words.. you can add as many keywords as you'd like.
Runs complete based on tasks, and errors.
Customize mode is for customizing your Resume and or coverletter...
Easy Apply Application has many modes to mix and match any users needs...
Customizing the resume just means it will hide the Job in your Resume some where to trick the automated system that screens resumes on dice.
it will also add the skills list to that list.
Customizing Coverletter will add the skills list from the job description on the web page in a location of your choosing spaced by commas.
as well as the recruiters name, the Job Position, and Company Name. Each need to be Unique, and absolute where you want to put them.
Each Customization is done by a search and replace. It only works with docx files and can convert them into PDF's...
Customization works by creating a new docx file with the changes and then converting that docx file to PDF... if you dont want PDF type no pdf in the settings.ini file.

When you downloaded the program you'll notice there was also a setting.ini file....
In the settings.ini file is where you can make changes based on your use cases...
Easy Apply Application expects that if your not using customization you already have a ready to use Resume uploaded to dice already.
IF customization is yes... when applying, Easy Apply Application will generate a Resume (docx, pdf). Coverletters are optional for all modes
Idle_mode is for cases that might have more then 2 steps for easy apply applications on dice. if its more then 2.. it will skip that tab and move on.
coverletter mode is optional just uploads what ever coverletter you have.
resume PDF creates the customized PDF
coverletter PDF creates
Working Directory gets updated each time the software runs
when modifying the locations make sure to use double back slashes.
Speed... Depends on your system.. if you want Easy Apply Application you need to put a number lower then 1.. Keep in mind each webpage takes
different amounts of time to load and dice uses containers to control their web pages.
to double your speed which is not recommended ".5" to go twice as slow "2" each customers system maybe able to handle different speeds.
At speed "1" you can get through approximally 180 applications an hour on its fastest mode, 50 on its slowest mode.

Easy Apply Application will have a user-interface soon, currently its not up to standards of testing.
if you have any questions or issues send an email to................
