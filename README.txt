There currently is no GUI(Graphic User Interface) for the software but one will be coming soon.
Easy Apply Bot take the list of soft and hard skill that you have designated in the text files explained below and compares those words and phrases to the words and phrases in the job description and skills list on the application web page. There are a lot of other working to ensure the best skills are added, as in tokenism and weighted selection to determine what is the best skills to add to your resume… 
the soft skills list will have bother your hard skills and soft skills, if a word is matched, the sentence next to that word is then added to your resume. 
For example say my soft skills list matches with the word “excel” for Microsoft excel… it will match that word then extract the sentence next to it… the sentence may be something like this “Proficient in Microsoft excel data analysis and data extraction” But with at least having hundreds if not a thousand skills in your soft skills list will allow you to maximize your tailoring to your resume…
